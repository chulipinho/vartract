## How to use

You can access the web application by clicking [here](Vartracthttps://chulipinho.github.io/vartract/).

To use Vartract you need to replace the variable information on your document file by Vartract's variables:

[\\name of your variable]

If the program identifies two or more variables with the same name, it will only generate one field and replace all of them with the same value.

At the time the app supports only DOCX files for both input and output. It is planned to add support for other formats such as DOC and PDF on future versions.
